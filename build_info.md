cant i see the production version of my website without deploying it on a cloud server

Yes, you can preview the production build of your React application locally on your machine without deploying it to a cloud server. To do this, you'll need to build your application for production and then serve the built files using a static server. Here's how you can do it:

Build Your Application:

First, create a production build of your React application. If you are using Create React App, you can do this by running:
bash
Copy code
npm run build
or
bash
Copy code
yarn build
This command creates a build directory with the production build of your app.
Install a Static Server:

You'll need a static server to serve your production files. One common option is serve, which can be installed globally via npm:
bash
Copy code
npm install -g serve
or, if you prefer using npx, you can skip the global installation and use it directly in the next step.
Serve the Production Build Locally:

After installing serve, navigate to your project directory in the terminal and run:
bash
Copy code
serve -s build
If you haven't installed serve globally and want to use npx, run:
bash
Copy code
npx serve -s build
This command will serve your static site on a local web server. serve will provide you with local URLs to access your application.
Access Your Application:

Open the URL provided by serve in your web browser to view your application in production mode.
Testing:

Test your application thoroughly to ensure it behaves as expected in a production environment. Since production builds often bundle and minify files differently than development builds, it's important to ensure everything works correctly.
This approach allows you to view and test your production build locally on your machine without the need to deploy it to a cloud server. It's a great way to catch any potential issues that might only occur in a production build before deploying your app to the public.
